            <p>
                I'm a software engineer passionate about building reliable backend systems and AI-powered tools.
                I recently worked on a content creator AI agent and developed a video streaming platform
                for EOTC MK Television Broadcast Service — winning 1st place in the MK ICT Competition 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in Computer Science from Addis Ababa University, I've gained hands-on
                experience with Python, Golang, RESTful APIs, microservices, CI/CD, and scalable architectures.
                I'm also deeply involved in competitive programming and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to build software solutions that have a real-world impact — globally.
